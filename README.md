# GuessTheFlag 
Project 2 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This app builds on previous skills and introduces more SwiftUI fundamentals. It is a simple game where the user is presented with three different flags and asked to select the one of a specific country. It updates their score as they go and shows an alert at the end, telling them the final score.
# Features
- Container views like VStack to arrange views.
- Creating simple buttons and adding styling modifiers.
- Using Image.

- General styling using colors and gradients.
